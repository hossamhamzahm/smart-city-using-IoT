# Smart City Uing IoT [Utopia](https://ecen203smartcity-hossamhamzahm-gmailcom.vercel.app/)

This project focuses on two parts of the smart city which are smart light poles and the smart garage or parking system. The smart light poles will turn off automatically in case of high light intensity in the day time and it will turn on automatically at night.Furthermore, the light can controlled from a website in manual mode. The smart garage is a system which enables people to view if there is any available parking slots and enables them to reserve it from a website. Moreover, the gate of the garage opens automatically whenever it detects a registered car infont of it.
